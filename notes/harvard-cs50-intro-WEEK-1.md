- **📘 Visual Studio Code for CS50**  
  My trusty coding playground — where the magic begins! 💻✨
- **👋 Hello World**  
  The classic first step into the programming universe. 🌍
- 📘 Visual Studio Code for CS50My trusty coding playground — where the magic begins!
- 👋 Hello WorldThe classic first step into the programming universe.
- 🏗️ From Scratch to CWent from dragging blocks to writing real code in C!
- 📄 Header Files and CS50 Manual PagesLearned how to import tools and read the docs like a pro.
- 🗣️ Hello, YouMade programs that actually talk to me (and ask for my name)!
- 🔢 TypesDiscovered different data types — int, string, float, and more!
- 🤔 ConditionalsTold my code to make decisions — if this, then that!
- 🧮 OperatorsPlayed with +, -, ==, !=, and friends. Math just got fun!
- 📦 VariablesStored and reused values like a coding wizard.
- ⚖️ compare.cWrote a program to compare values — who's bigger?
- ✅ agree.cLet users say yes or no — interaction time!
- 🔁 Loops and meow.cMade my code repeat like a loop-de-loop rollercoaster!
- 🧩 FunctionsBuilt reusable blocks of code — modularity FTW!
- 🎨 Correctness, Design, StyleAimed for clean, working code that looks good too!
- 🟥 MarioBuilt pyramids like a game dev — # by #.
- 📝 CommentsLeft notes for future me — because why not?
- ➕ More About OperatorsDug deeper into logical and bitwise magic.
- ✂️ TruncationFound out what happens when numbers get cut short.
- 🧾 Summing UpTime to reflect — I've leveled up in CS!

### 🔁 From Source Code to Machine Code  
- 🧠 Machines only speak binary  
  Deep down, computers understand just ones and zeros — it's all 1s and 0s to them.  
- 📝 Humans write source code  
  We write code in languages like C because, let’s face it — binary is hard for us. Source code is a list of instructions that we can read and write.  
- 💥 Machine code produces a desired effect  
  That binary pattern creates actions, like lighting up a pixel or printing "Hello, world!"  
- 🧑‍💻 The compiler is our translator  
  A compiler takes our human-friendly C code and turns it into fast, efficient machine code.  
- 🛠️ Meet your C compiler  
  Today, you're getting introduced to a compiler that will help you build and run C programs — welcome to the translation business!

## 🔧 Inside the Compiler: Tools You’ll Use  
- 🧠 **The Compiler’s Structure**: The compiler can be divided into a number of regions — all designed to help you write, manage, and run your code with ease.  
- 🖥️ **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: On the left side is the file explorer where you can find your files. In the middle is the text editor where you write and edit your programs. At the bottom is the terminal window where you can interact with the system using commands.  
- 🖱️ **Terminal Window (CLI)**: This is where you type commands to communicate directly with the computer in the cloud. It’s powerful, fast, and essential for developers.  
- 📁 **`cd`**: Use this to move between folders — like walking through different rooms in a house.  
- 📄 **`cp`**: Copy files or folders — like making a duplicate of a document.  
- 📋 **`ls`**: List all the files in your current folder — like checking what’s inside a drawer.  
- 📁 **`mkdir`**: Create a brand-new folder — your own custom storage space.  
- 🔄 **`mv`**: Move or rename files — like picking up a file and placing it somewhere else or giving it a new name.  
- 🗑️ **`rm`**: Delete files — use with care, there's no undo button!  
- 🗑️📁 **`rmdir`**: Delete entire folders — again, double-check before hitting enter!
